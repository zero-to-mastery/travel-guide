    <p>
      Welcome to Sweden with its beautiful landscapes and its genuine culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweden is located in north of Europe. Due to its remote location there
      are just around 10 million people living in Sweden.<br>
      The majority people lives in the south part of Sweden where the major cities are the
      capital Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo.

      In Sweden there are many things to see. In july there are a lot of
      popuplar beaches and in the north the sun is up 24 hours per day.<br>
      This is due to that northen part of Sweden is located above the pole circle.
      In the winter almost all parts of Sweden is covered in white snow.<br>
      Then Sweden is very good for skiing and skating.
